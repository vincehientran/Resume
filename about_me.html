    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <p>I am a fourth year CS student and I am currently pursuing a
      Bachelor's and a Master's of Science in Computer Science. I am
      focused on the application of computer vision techniques. I
      believe that the future of technology revolves around allowing computers
      to perceive and to understand the world in the same way humans do.</p>
    <p>I have been a teaching assistant for a couple of years now. One
      of the main skills that I have learned while being a teaching
      assistant is how to break down hard problems into smaller and
      more manageable problems. This allowed me to easily make analogies
      to explain tough problems that the students are confused about.
      I believe that becoming a teaching assistant made me a stronger
      communicator.</p>
    <p>I believe that I am ready to work professionally
      alongside other ambitious teammates.</p>
